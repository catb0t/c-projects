# car-loan

**Language: C11 with GNU extensions**

---

In a new .java file, create a program that asks the user to input the total amount of a carâ€™s price (loan amount), the length of the loan in years, the interest rate of the loan and any down payment given.

Your goal is to print out the monthly payment you would pay on the loan (remember to include interest).

You should build in safeguards to make sure the length of the loan and the interest rate are both greater than 0, and that the down payment is not larger than the total car loan.  You should print out statements so the user is aware what is incorrect; it is OK if the program ends if any of these conditions are true.

To check your program, you can enter these sample values:

Car loan amount of $10,000
Length of loan of 3 years
Interest Rate of 5%
Down payment of $2000

Given these inputs, your program should output a monthly payment of $233.

Make sure you give your program adequate commenting/documentation.
