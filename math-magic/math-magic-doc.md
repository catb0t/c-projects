# Problem

Create an int variable called myNumber and set it equal to any integer you like. We will refer to this integer as the original number from now on.

Next, create an int variable called stepOne and set it equal to the original number (myNumber) multiplied by itself.

Create an int variable called stepTwo and set it equal to the previous result (stepOne) plus the original number (myNumber).

Next, create an int variable called stepThree and set it equal to the previous result divided by the original number.

Create an int variable called stepFour and set it equal to to the previous result plus 17.

Next, create an int variable called stepFive and set it equal to the previous result minus the original number.

Now create an int variable called stepSix and set it equal to the previous result divided by 6.

Finally, use System.out.println(stepSix) to print out the value of the last step. What number prints to the console? This number will be printed to the console no matter what integer you choose as the original number!
